# Auxie

A collection of auxiliary types, methods, functions and other small useful 
things.  

The name Auxie comes from the short name AUX which in its turn comes from a 
full word Auxiliary. For historical reasons, the word AUX is forbidden to be 
used as a folder name in operating systems based on MS-DOS and Windows.
