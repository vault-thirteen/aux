## Simple Merge Sorter

A simple and fast merge sorter for integer (`int`) values.  
Value type can easily be changed to floating point numbers (`float64`) by 
changing just a couple of code lines.  

**Notes**  
Until a working type switch for generics appears in Go language, this library 
is not using generic types.  
Let us hope, it happens in this life.
