# BOM
### Byte Order Mark

Functions and methods to work with BOM.  
BOM is a byte order mark.  

The byte order mark (BOM) is a particular usage of the special Unicode 
character, whose appearance as a magic number at the start of a text stream 
can signal several things to a program reading the text:  
* The byte order, or endianness, of the text stream in the cases of 16-bit and 
32-bit encodings;
* The fact that the text stream's encoding is Unicode, to a high level of 
confidence;
* Which Unicode character encoding is used.
