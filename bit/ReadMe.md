A simple library to work with bits in Go programming language.

This library allows to convert bytes to bits and bits to bytes.  
Bits are stored in memory as separate objects.

The main purpose of this library is a tool for work with bits which 
allows to use bits as objects directly. It uses big amount of memory while 
it stores each separate bit as boolean value.
